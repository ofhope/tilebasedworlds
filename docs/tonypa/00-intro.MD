WELCOME
Here you can read some tutorials about making tile based games with Macromedia Flash.

These tutorial are heavily based on OutsideOfSociety tutorials by Klas Kroon. Go and read them anyway, those are one of best you can find.

These tutorials expect you to know something about actionscript and Macromedia Flash. They might be too hard to understand, if you never before made any games with Flash. And as my English is not very good, there are probably lots of mistakes and some parts might not be well explained. Im sorry, I do my best. If you find bugs or mistakes, let me know.

I have used Flash5 to create the code and source files. Mainly because I am used to Flash5 and I work fast with it. The code and source files work well in FlashMX (ver6) too, you shouldnt have problems with them. The FlashMX2004 (ver7) with new AS2 is not compatible with older actionscript, so the code might fail. It might work too, but generally, if you really want to use AS2, you should write new code yourself. The principles, of course, you can still use, so it might be worth look through the tutorials anyway.

Examples and code and source files presented here are free to use. You can modify them as you wish, you can use them anyway you like.

I hope someone finds something useful here :)

Thanks
Tony
