# Tile Based Worlds

This site aims to educate and inspire. No programming experience is required. 

[Tile Base Worlds](https://tilebasedworlds.com/) is a website to explore the fun and beauty of ordered tile worlds. Mostly in the context of games but can also be useful for other creative computing tasks.

Using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for creating our worlds. This is an approachable library that suits beginners to advanced users. It is supported by the processing foundation which has an active community and a great inclusion policy.

## Motivation for creating

This set of tutorials was inspired by Tonypa's tile-based tutorials by Tonu Paldra. Originally published here `http://www.tonypa.pri.ee/tbw/index.html` but the domain has since dropped. I stumbled across the content on an Action Script dev forum [goToAndPlay](http://www.gotoandplay.it/_articles/2004/02/tonypa.php).  And wanted to modernise this work. This series of posts was a huge piece of inspiration for me back in the day (10+ years ago now). I was so excited to discover the mechanics behind some of my favourite games like Pokemon, Advanced Wars, Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy.

The original tutorials were written for Action Script 2.0 and Macromedia Flash (before Adobe brought it). Here I'd like to focus on Javascript and Browser first in a native format. This is free and accessible to everyone without requiring any libraries. There are some other great options like PyGame or Lua Love. If time allows I'll update the examples to include these but if not they're worth exploring yourself.

The aim is to demystify some of the mechanics in an approachable way and ultimately inspire you the reader to go out and make some games yourself.
